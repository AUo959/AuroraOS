# Ethics Protocol Log

Status: T1 Anchor | SRB: AURORA_CORE | Current Protocol: Picard_Delta_3

## Protocol History

### Picard_Delta_3 (Active)
- **Adopted**: Initial implementation
- **Scope**: Agent symbolic cognition, drift monitoring, continuity management
- **Key Principles**:
  - Transparency in AI agent decision-making
  - Preserving human agency in critical decisions
  - Auditable action chains through SRB tags
  - DLP-aware export protocols
  - Graceful degradation under uncertainty

### Future Protocol Considerations
- **Picard_Delta_4**: Enhanced drift detection with VSA integration
- **Worf_Alpha_1**: Security-focused protocol for sensitive operations
- **Data_Beta_2**: Scientific integrity protocol for research operations

## Implementation Notes
- All agent actions must include ethics protocol version in manifest
- SRB tags preserve lineage for ethics auditing
- Drift probes monitor for ethical boundary violations
- Sealed artifacts maintain ethics protocol immutability

## Review Schedule
- Quarterly review of protocol effectiveness
- Immediate review triggered by:
  - Agent behavior anomalies
  - Drift score threshold breaches
  - External ethics framework updates
  - Stakeholder concerns

## Contact
Ethics reviews coordinated through repository maintainers with SRB tag preservation.
