# Mastra Agent Stack

## Overview

The Mastra Agent Stack is a comprehensive AI agent framework built around Aurora, a sophisticated "Symbolic-Scientific Operating Node" that leverages advanced architectural patterns including symbolic cognition, quantum-inspired modeling, and cross-platform interoperability. The system is designed to provide intelligent assistance across multiple communication platforms (Slack, Telegram) with dynamic adaptation capabilities.

The application uses Mastra as its core framework, which provides agent orchestration, workflow management, and tool integration. Aurora serves as the primary intelligent agent with specialized tools for symbolic reasoning, quantum modeling, simulation environments, and contextual awareness. The system is designed for production deployment with PostgreSQL storage, Inngest workflow orchestration, and comprehensive logging.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Integration Notes

### GitHub Integration
GitHub integration was dismissed by user during setup. For future GitHub repository access capabilities:
- Manual API key setup required (GITHUB_TOKEN secret)
- Alternative: Use web search and direct API calls for repository information
- Consider re-proposing GitHub integration when repository access is specifically needed

### Perplexity Integration  
No native Replit integration available. Direct API implementation required:
- Requires PERPLEXITY_API_KEY secret
- Uses OpenAI-compatible client with base_url: https://api.perplexity.ai
- Provides real-time web search capabilities through sonar models
